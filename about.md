Jonathan began his professional career in the military, working in help desk and network specialist roles. A few promotions later, he was assigned to work as a communications advisor to a foreign military. He excelled in this role by using his interpersonal skills to break through language barriers and enable his military counterparts to become self-sufficient. While working with Jonathan, the military unit enhanced their training from basic classroom instruction to running their battle room simulations in a command center simulated environment. Jonathan was awarded a meritorious promotion for his work overseas. During his time in the Marine Corps Reserve, Jonathan also worked in law enforcement as a police officer. His chain of command commended Jonathan on multiple occasions for his quick decision-making skills and calm demeanor under extremely tense and volatile situations. For six years, Jonathan balanced his military and law enforcement careers while at the same time learning the necessary skills to transition to his current role as a Security Operations Center (SOC) analyst.

I may not be

I may not be the fastest
I may not be the tallest
     Or the strongest

I may not be the best
Or the brightest

    But one thing I can do better
     Than anyone else...

      That is

        To be me

- Leonard Nimoy
